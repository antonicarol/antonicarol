### Who am I? üêç

üòÑ My name is Antoni Carol Mateo and I'm a FullStack developer, working up to became a Blockchain developer. I love computers, those geenies that can make your wishes came true if you talk to them in his language and with respect.
<hr>


üå± I define myself as a Stubborn and Optimistic creator, I cant leave things without being done, I always work hard to achieve my goals, and in a really creative way, seeking problems with a positive point of view.

‚ö° On the other hand, I'm an easy-going and shameless person, I love Rap Music and I love freestyling, so I've learned to win my fears and show myself to the public. I also love Extreme Sports, I ride scooter since I was 10 years old. I've crashed and hurt myself uncountable times, but that teached me to always get up and try again harder!

<hr>

üì´ I live in Igualada, Barcelona. I have a really good english due to the hours I've spent playing videogames and programming.

### What I Do? üî≠

üëØ Currently I'm working as a Freelancer, developing the projects Clients want to bring alive. I'm specialized in FullStack, working with tools like React and Next.js for the Frontend, and Node.js for the Backend. I'm also working on decentraliced applications, building and deploying Smart Contracts using Solidity, through EVM compatible blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom and the Binance Smart Chain

If I have to talk about tools, programming languages, these would be the ones I used and I'm familiar with:
