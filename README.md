### Who am I? 🐍

😄 My name is Antoni Carol Mateo and I'm studying to be a FullStack Developer. I love computers, those geenies that can make your wishes came true if you talk to them in his language and with respect.
<hr>


🌱 I define myself as a Stubborn and Optimistic creator, I cant leave things without being done, I always work hard to achieve my goals, and in a really creative way, seeking problems with a positive point of view.

⚡ On the other hand, I'm an easy-going and shameless person, I love Rap Music and I love freestyling, so I've learned to win my fears and show myself to the public. I also love Extreme Sports, I ride scooter since I was 10 years old. I've crashed and hurt myself uncountable times, but that teached me to always get up and try again harder!

<hr>

📫 I live in Igualada, Barcelona. I have a really good english due to the hours I've spent playing videogames and programming.

### What I Do? 🔭

👯 Currently I'm studing a Degree in Degree in Digital Interaction and Computing Techniques, for 2 years. Here, I've learned the basics of Programming, User-Expirience, Software Engineering and Other aspects. But I've had been working on my own in order to grow my skills and knowledge.

If I have to talk about tools, programming languages, these would be the ones I used and I'm familiar with:
